# Public Transport Workers' Appreciation Day

Our public transport (PT) workers work tirelessly and behind the scenes to ensure our public transport system is safe, reliable and comfortable. To show appreciation and encouragement to the workers, the first Saturday of November is designated as Public Transport Workersâ€™ Appreciation Day and it is celebrated throughout the month of November with a line-up of appreciation activities.  
  
The Public Transport Operators and National Transport Workers Union, together with LTA, are the partners for the event.

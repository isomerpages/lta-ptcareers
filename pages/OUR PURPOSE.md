## About the Public Transport Industry
Public transport is the core of Singapore’s Land Transport Industry and a key enabler for Singapore’s economy. Every day, almost 5.5 million commuter journeys are taken on our public buses and trains for work, school and leisure.

Today, the public transport sector employs more than 22,000 people in the public bus and rail sectors. As the rail network expands and public bus services increase to support connectivity, it is projected that up to 10,000 new jobs will be created by the year 2040.

As Singapore moves towards a car-lite vision, our rail network will become denser and our public bus services will be more extensive. Commuters will be able to travel seamlessly and efficiently around Singapore. Our land transport system, in particular, public transport, has to remain reliable, convenient, comfortable, safe and secure for commuters to reach their destinations.

## Industry Outlook
Today, our rail and public bus sectors employ more than 22,000 people to support the 5.5 million journeys made on public transport each day. With the expansion of our public bus and rail networks, we expect to create up to 10,000 new public transport jobs for Singaporeans from now to 2040.

To better serve commuters in the future, we are transforming our urban landscape through greener travel, greater connectivity and leveraging emerging technologies to deliver smarter and better services.

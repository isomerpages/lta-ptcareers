**Q: What intrigued you to pursue a career in the Public Transport industry?**

A: I grew up taking the public transport. It’s an indispensable part of my life. I jumped at the opportunity to play a part in improving and enhancing land transport sustainability.

**Q: Share with us what you do.**

A: I am a Permanent Way (P-way) & Civil Structure Engineer with SBS Transit Rail. I am also the Head of Rail Maintenance for the Downtown Line (DTL).

Together with my team, we ensure that the tracks are in top condition for smooth and safe rides. I also helm the quality assurance team and train new engineers/ technicians in defect analysis. Part of my job requires me to monitor trends to identify problems, develop pre-emptive solutions as well as improve work processes.

**Q: What is P-way?**

A: P-way, the abbreviation of Permanent Way, refers to the finished track for a railway.

In the earlier days of railway construction, contractors often laid temporary tracks to transport construction materials to and from the site; these temporary tracks are removed when the work is completed. Thus, Permanent Way is used to distinguish the final finished tracks from the temporary ones.

**Q: What are the opportunities that the industry offers to graduates with technical or engineering qualifications?**

A: SBS Transit Rail provides graduates with ample chances to attend specialised technical training courses, to ensure that they uphold maintenance standards to provide safe and reliable rail services for all commuters. Graduates are also encouraged and given opportunities to acquire professional engineer accreditations such as Railway Chartered Engineer.

**Q: What keeps you motivated in your role?**

A: My work has helped to ensure that commuters are able to travel seamlessly and efficiently around Singapore. This gives me a great sense of satisfaction knowing that I have contributed to keeping Singapore moving.

**Q: Share with us any achievement or memorable moment you have experienced in your work.**

A: One night, there was an issue that may require urgent rectification works. I rushed down to site and decisively assessed that the rail condition was safe for operation. This incident has impressed upon me that my work plays a significant role and spurs me to continue working hard in the Rail industry.

**Q: What are the challenges in your role, and how do you overcome them?**

A: Most of our maintenance works have to be carried out during the wee hours of the night. It is often challenging to complete the works in a short time frame. However, we have a dedicated and passionate team with high synergy, and we’re able to quickly complete the maintenance and ensure that the trains can be launched on time every single day.

**Q: As you look at the industry's future, what excites you the most?**

A: Singapore is expanding its rail infrastructure in the next 10 years. There’s also renewal works on our existing lines to ensure the reliability of the network. There’s an abundance of opportunities for me, an aspiring railway engineer!

**Q: What would you say to someone considering a role in the industry?**

A: If you enjoy the challenge of working in a highly-dynamic and multi-disciplinary engineering environment, a job in the rail industry is one career to consider. There are internship and scholarship opportunities available for young and aspiring engineers/ technicians. This is a sunrise industry with excellent learning opportunities and a good future prospect.

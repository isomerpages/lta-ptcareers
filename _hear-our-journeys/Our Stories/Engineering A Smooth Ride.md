<p>Mr Jonathan Teoh experiences the deepest job satisfaction when passengers
are so comfortable that they barely notice the bus they’re on.</p>
<p>According to the senior manager of bus logistics and maintenance at SMRT
Buses, that’s the ultimate testament to a job well done by the bus engineers
and technicians. Said Mr Teoh: “A tremendous amount of work goes into every
bus, from planning, scheduling and maintenance to conducting improvement
projects and regular inspections. All of this is done to ensure a safe
and reliable experience for commuters.”</p>

<p><em>Mr Jonathan Teoh, senior manager of bus logistics and maintenance at SMRT Buses, says that a rewarding internship experience while he was an undergraduate helped kindle his passion for the public transport industry.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>BUILDING A TECHNICAL FOUNDATION</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Teoh’s journey into the world of bus engineering began during his time
at Nanyang Technological University, where he took up an internship with
SMRT and learnt the intricacies of commercial fleet maintenance contracts.</p>
<p>“The rewarding internship experience kindled my passion for this industry,”
he recalled. “I joined SMRT Automotive Services right after graduating
in 2012 with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronic Engineering.”</p>
<p>Mr Teoh started his career in 2012 in the engineering department, which
handles the purchase of buses and taxis. The department was also responsible
for various projects and system implementations that gave him a technical
foundation of vehicular technologies.</p>
<p>In 2016, Mr Teoh was transferred to the bus maintenance department of
SMRT Buses. He then moved on to bus logistics and maintenance at SMRT Buses
and has been with the team since 2020. While his initiation into the world
of bus engineering was challenging, Mr Teoh’s willingness to ask questions,
roll up his sleeves and engage in continuous self learning gave him invaluable
on-the-job knowledge.</p>

</div>
<p><em>Mr Teoh’s day starts with a toolbox briefing with engineers, supervisors and technicians.</em>
</p>
<p>“I had to familiarise myself with the technical aspects of various bus
makes and models. Each has a unique set of subsystems, such as the engine,
transmission, doors and air-conditioning,” he recounted.</p>
<p>“I spent a lot of time with my technicians and reached out to original-equipment
manufacturers to clarify my doubts. The experience broadened and deepened
my technical capabilities and knowledge, allowing me now to better guide
my team. My learning journey progresses as new bus models are continually
added to the SMRT bus fleet.”</p>
<h4><strong>A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A BUS ENGINEER</strong></h4>
<p>8am: Mr Teoh starts his day with a toolbox briefing with engineers, supervisors
and technicians. “This is where we have our daily SMRT Safety Moment –
a session to reinforce the importance of safety in every task – and share
workshop key performance indicators. We also check on the buses scheduled
for the afternoon, technical bulletins and other operational matters,”
he said.</p>
<p>10am: He holds meetings with stakeholders spanning bus operations, maintenance
and inventory engineering, manufacturers and original-equipment manufacturers.</p>
<p>2pm: Mr Teoh conducts walks on the ground to communicate with technicians.
“Daily communication with my staff is essential. It fosters a safe environment
where they feel comfortable seeking assistance if required.”</p>
<p>4pm-6pm: The day usually ends after ensuring that there are enough buses
for the evening peak hour, concluding with a housekeeping routine in the
workshop.</p>
<p><strong>OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGINEER CAREER GROWTH</strong>
</p>
<p>Beyond technical knowledge, Mr Teoh believes that excellent communication
skills are vital, especially when dealing with novel or complex situations
where solutions are not readily available.</p>
<p>“Effective communication makes a big difference in how tasks and projects
are executed,” he explained. “I enjoy gathering diverse insights to come
up with an effective technical solution.”</p>

<p><em>“SMRT BUSES OFFERS A DYNAMIC LEARNING LANDSCAPE WHERE I HAVE THE CHANCE TO LEAD KEY PROJECTS, GO ON OVERSEAS LEARNING AND NETWORKING TRIPS, AND STAY ABREAST OF THE LATEST ADVANCEMENTS IN BUS TECHNOLOGY. THIS, IN TURN, HELPS FINE-TUNE OUR MAINTENANCE PROCESSES AND PROMOTES KNOWLEDGE-SHARING WITH OTHER OPERATORS.”</em>
</p>
<p><em>– MR JONATHAN TEOH, SENIOR MANAGER OF BUS LOGISTICS AND MAINTENANCE, SMRT BUSES</em>
</p>
<p>Mr Teoh was also involved in the procurement of buses. “I was part of
the engineering team in charge of technical specifications, tender evaluation
and bus selection,” he shared. “This allowed me to experience the end-to-end
process, from project conceptualisation to bus delivery. Having the chance
to delve into intricate details like the chassis, body and sub-systems
was eye-opening. It was almost like building a bus from scratch, which
drove home the precision needed to provide a smooth and reliable journey
for commuters.”</p>

<p><em>Mr Tay Thian Jun, technical specialist at Go-Ahead Singapore, has acquired a robust foundation in diagnostics and electrical knowledge, which is an important skillset as half of Singapore’s public bus fleet will be electric by 2030.</em>
</p>
<p>Mr Tay’s passion for large vehicles like buses has been a driving force
in his career. He is particularly intrigued by electric buses and how they
operate without an engine and fuel tank. Buses equipped with solar panels
are another source of fascination. “The slim solar panels fitted on bus
roofs can barely be seen, yet they are effective in reducing fuel consumption,”
he said.</p>
<h4><strong>Q&amp;A: WHAT DOES A BUS TECHNICIAN DO?</strong></h4>
<p>“My supervisor on the maintenance team will first identify buses that
need to be fixed. My team and I will then use a diagnostics tool to identify
their faults before rectifying them. We work on several buses daily, all
while ensuring that the workshop is clean and safe as we go about our&nbsp;duties.</p>
<p>Our goal is to turn around the buses quickly to support daily deployment.
We feel a great sense of job satisfaction when we finish repairing all
the buses on time.”</p>

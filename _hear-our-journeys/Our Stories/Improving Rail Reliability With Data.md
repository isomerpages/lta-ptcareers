<p><strong>Q: What intrigued you to pursue a career in the Public Transport industry?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>A: I always think that the public transport system in Singapore is very
convenient and was curious about the work behind it and believe it will
be a rewarding career for me.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Share with us what you do as a Signalling &amp; Communications Engineer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>A: As a Signalling &amp; Communications Maintenance Engineer, I work closely
with my colleagues to resolve issues, rectify faults and follow-up works.
Some of these works include troubleshooting and working on the improvement
of platform screen doors, to bolster their performance and enhance our
trains’ reliability.</p>
<p>Our team also ensure that preventive and corrective maintenance of railway
signalling systems and its associated equipment are conducted. Through
predictive technology, we collect data and conduct trend analysis, so that
equipment performance can be monitored closely, and maintenance work can
be prioritised.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the opportunities that the industry offers to graduates with technical or engineering qualifications?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A: There are various engineering roles in this industry, from handling
and resolving ground maintenance and technical issues, improving existing
processes in the system, managing projects. Engineering thinking and knowledge
are definitely required in the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What keeps you motivated in your role?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>A: It’s the sense of achievement when problems are solved, knowing that
my role and work contributed to the service and reliability of public transport.
I like that my work is very dynamic, not limited to only technical engineering,
but it involves a lot of communication, planning and management skills.
This makes the work challenging and interesting at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Share with us any achievement or memorable moment you have experienced in your work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>A: One notable achievement was my time managing Signalling Field Services
maintenance team during the challenging transition period of SMRT's North
South-East West Line re-signalling. This critical phase demanded meticulous
maintenance planning for both the old and new systems, while simultaneously
preparing the team for the operation of the new system.</p>
<p>It was a critical period in ensuring a seamless transition by continuously
engaging and motivating the team under my charge and making sure they are
ready for the new system. Our team in maintenance work closely together,
overseeing various aspects of maintenance logistics, including the preparation
of special tools and testing equipment, the procurement and management
of maintenance spares, ensuring the maintenance management system was up
to date. Effort was paid-off when the new system was successfully running
and our ground maintenance staff are well prepared for the new system.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the challenges in your role, and how do you overcome them?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>A: At the beginning of my career, it was a challenge leading a team of
experienced technical professionals. I knew that I had to quickly build
my confidence and gain trust from the team, by engaging them, working closely
with them on the ground, addressing concerns and providing unwavering support.</p>
<p>Moving forward to my role today, it involves the challenge in managing
various internal and external stakeholders, long-term service support contract,
various aspects of continuous improvement work. Maintaining good communication
and collaboration relationship is important in resolving organisational
and technical challenges as well as getting work done in time.</p>
<p>I strongly believe in a positive and cohesive team work environment, valuing
every team member, with collaborative and inclusive leadership style.</p>
<p><strong>Q: As you look at the industry's future, what excites you the most?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A: Many upcoming MRT lines connecting different parts of Singapore and
making every area accessible to public transport.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What would you say to someone considering a role in the industry?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A: I would say this is an industry for everyone looking for a challenging
yet satisfying career. It is not just a job, but a career that makes a
difference in Singapore’s transport system.</p>

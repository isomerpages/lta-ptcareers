<p>For senior bus captain Abdul Lathiff Mohamed Rafi, who is 50 years old,
driving isn’t just a job – it’s a source of pleasure and pride, which he
derives from providing guidance to newcomer bus captains and by ensuring
a safe and comfortable ride for all passengers.</p>
<p>Having enjoyed driving all types of motor vehicles since he was a young
man, he joined SBS Transit in 2000 after working in a family business and
as a head cashier at a department store.</p>
<p>A typical day for Mr Lathiff starts at 5am, when he arrives at Ulu Pandan
Bus Depot to either fulfil his driving responsibilities or take on mentoring
duties. “As a mentor, I provide guidance to newcomers as well as bus captains
who may require extra attention,” he explained.</p>

<p><em>As a standby bus captain, Mr Lathiff (left) takes on mentoring duties in addition to his driving responsibilities.</em>
</p>
<p>With 23 years of experience as a bus captain, Mr Lathiff is not just well-versed
in the job’s routines – he has also memorised an impressive 42 different
bus service routes in his role as a standby bus captain. Achieving this
feat is the result of his extensive experience and passion for operating
buses. “Learning these routes by heart enables me to be flexible and ready
to operate any of the services when needed,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that more than just memorising where to go, knowing a route well
involves understanding its particular challenges and being able to anticipate
passengers’ needs. His knowledge of service routes comes in handy when
passengers ask for directions and, whenever possible, he goes the extra
mile to ensure they’re on the right bus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<em>"SEEING PASSENGERS’ SMILE WHEN THEY BOARD THE BUS IS INCREDIBLY REWARDING. IT’S HEARTWARMING TO RECEIVE THIS&nbsp;ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, KNOWING THAT THE WORK WE DO&nbsp;IS&nbsp;VALUED&nbsp;AND APPRECIATED."</em>
</p>
<p><em>– MR ABDUL LATHIFF MOHAMED RAFI, SENIOR&nbsp;BUS CAPTAIN, SBS TRANSIT</em>
</p>
<p>Mr Lathiff’s dedication to providing excellent service also involves paying
attention to the little things that make a difference: “During trips, I
always prioritise allowing the elderly, pregnant and other vulnerable passengers
to be seated comfortably before moving off.”</p>

<p><em>Having memorised an impressive 42 service routes, Mr Lathiff is well-positioned to provide assistance to&nbsp;passengers who ask for directions.</em>
</p>
<p>Mr Lathiff added that the most enjoyable aspect of his role is the variety
it offers, as he is often assigned to different routes to assist with operational
needs. “It keeps every day unique and engaging,” he&nbsp;explained.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE SOME ESSENTIAL QUALITIES A&nbsp;<br>BUS&nbsp;CAPTAIN SHOULD POSSESS?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: “Patience and a strong commitment to safety. Patience comes in handy
not only when dealing with unexpected traffic, but also in understanding
passengers’ diverse&nbsp;needs.</p>
<p>Safety is my top priority. I am committed to driving safely and ensuring
the well-being of&nbsp;my&nbsp;passengers.”</p>

</p>
<p><strong>INVESTING IN PEOPLE AND SERVICES</strong>
</p>
<p>Bus captains can rise through the ranks to reach the position of chief
bus captain. Alternatively, they could pivot to a career path in interchange
or depot operations, the bus operations control centre or&nbsp;training.</p>
<p>To gain the necessary skills needed to excel and progress in their careers,
they can rely on training programmes offered in-house and at the LTA’s
Singapore Bus Academy.</p>

</div>
<p>For health-conscious Mr Lathiff, his company’s health screening and coaching
programme stand out as among the most valuable perks of the job.</p>
<p>These sessions have given him the knowledge and motivation to monitor
and improve his health and&nbsp;fitness.</p>
<p>“Maintaining good health enables bus captains to carry out their responsibilities
effectively, as our profession demands our full attention while driving,”
he said. “I want to ensure that I’m in the best condition to perform my
duties safely and efficiently.”</p>
<p>Mr Lathiff’s enthusiasm hasn’t waned in his third decade on the job. “Being
a bus captain is very rewarding and I am always appreciative of a friendly
greeting. Whenever I meet my regulars, we would greet each other warmly.
As this is my passion, I always have the mindset that everything is manageable
and achievable,” he said. “My family and my commitment to delivering exceptional
service are the driving forces that motivate me to do well in my job.”</p>

<p><strong>ENSURING A SMOOTH START FOR COMMUTERS BEHIND THE SCENES</strong>
</p>
<p>Unlike Mr Lathiff, Mr Mohammad Asri Murat’s job does not involve interacting
with commuters, but his work is just as important in ensuring that they
arrive at their destinations on time.</p>
<p>At 4.30am, while most of us are still comfortably tucked in bed, Mr Asri
would have arrived at Bulim Bus Depot, ready to start his day overseeing
the running of the earliest bus services.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old bus service controller at Tower Transit Singapore rotates
between the morning and evening shifts. While he admitted that the early
call time for the morning shift initially took some getting used to, Mr
Asri has no regrets: Joining this industry is the natural outcome of his
passion for buses – an interest that was cultivated during childhood when
his parents took him out for joyrides on the public bus network.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="box-sizing: inherit; border-style: none; display: block; height: auto; max-width: 100%; border-radius: 0px; line-height: 1.4; width: 760px; padding-top: 20px;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--B_d-XiGc--/c_fill,g_auto,h_468,w_830/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2023/11/13/bstudio_lta_busops_img03.jpg?itok=Qv4QOUwx">
</div>
<p><em>Mr Mohammad Asri Murat, a bus service controller at Tower Transit Singapore, says that his interest in the public&nbsp;transport industry was kindled when he was a young boy.</em>
</p>
<p>These bus rides sparked a lifelong hobby that eventually became his career.
From posting on local forums for bus enthusiasts and running a social media
account dedicated to Singapore buses, Mr Asri took the plunge to become
a bus service controller after completing his National Service in 2021,
having graduated with a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering
in 2019.</p>
<p>On his scope of work, Mr Asri shared: “A service controller plays a crucial
role in maintaining consistency and addressing unexpected events in bus
services. This includes managing delays caused by traffic or roadblocks,
ensuring that there are sufficient buses available to meet passenger demand.”</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="box-sizing: inherit; border-style: none; display: block; height: auto; max-width: 100%; border-radius: 0px; line-height: 1.4; width: 760px; padding-top: 20px;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--wO8ZmLu9--/c_fill,g_auto,h_468,w_830/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2023/11/13/bstudio_lta_busops_img04.jpg?itok=2b1vFy37">
</div>
<p><em>Being a bus service controller involves anticipating the unexpected and keeping a cool head when things get hectic, says Mr Asri.</em>
</p>
<p>Two years on, he says that being a bus service controller is far from
a simple office job. It involves anticipating the unexpected and developing
the resilience required to make critical decisions.</p>
<p>“You must have a certain steadfastness to supervise many bus captains
at the same time,” he explained. “While it’s sometimes inevitable for them
to arrive at the respective stops earlier than scheduled, we work closely
with them to regulate their speed and ensure bus frequencies are adhered
to.”</p>

<p><strong>MOVING PEOPLE IS WHAT KEEPS HIM&nbsp;GOING</strong>
</p>
<p>With the support of his family – who were delighted that he had secured
his dream career working with buses – and the help of his colleagues, Mr
Asri has developed greater confidence in his role.</p>
<p>“My colleagues are like my family,” he said. “They are very helpful in
times of crisis, ever ready to swoop in to ease my&nbsp;stress.”</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="box-sizing: inherit; border-style: none; display: block; height: auto; max-width: 100%; border-radius: 0px; line-height: 1.4; width: 760px; padding-top: 20px;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--YaGz6Ju8--/c_fill,g_auto,h_468,w_830/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2023/11/13/bstudio_lta_busops_img05.jpg?itok=QmhZA5i0">
</div>
<p><em>Mr Asri works in a tight-knit team and says that his colleagues are always ready to render assistance when needed.</em>
</p>
<p>When things get hectic, Mr Asri keeps a cool head and swings into action
by deciding on the next steps to minimise service delays. For example,
when <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/big-tree-city-plaza-cut-down-after-toppling-road-and-crushing-vehicles-sept-10-2251586" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a tree fell along Paya Lebar Road</a> in
September 2023, causing a traffic obstruction, he was quick to seek approval
to divert the affected buses plying the Service&nbsp;853M route.</p>
<p>Even after getting approval, Mr Asri had to provide guidance to bus captains
who were unfamiliar with the new route, keeping in mind that commuters
whose journeys had been affected were counting on his&nbsp;actions.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, the situation was resolved very quickly as we work together
as a team. Staff on the ground were quick to render assistance as well,”
he recalled.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="box-sizing: inherit; border-style: none; display: block; height: auto; max-width: 100%; border-radius: 0px; line-height: 1.4; width: 760px; padding-top: 20px;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--iH8f1y28--/c_fill,g_auto,h_468,w_830/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2023/11/13/bstudio_lta_busops_img06.jpg?itok=HVm-pAyy">
</div>
<p><em>&nbsp;"I FEEL A GREAT SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT WHEN I MANAGE TO GET OUR SERVICES BACK ON TRACK AFTER A MAJOR TRAFFIC DELAY. BY&nbsp;EMPLOYING SERVICE CONTROL STRATEGIES AND WITH A LITTLE LUCK, SOMETIMES THE STARS ALIGN AND WE’RE ABLE TO GET OUR BUSES TO ARRIVE AT THE BUS STOPS IN A TIMELY MANNER, AS IF NOTHING EVER HAPPENED. THAT FEELING IS MAGICAL!"</em>
</p>
<p><em>– MR MOHAMMAD ASRI MURAT, BUS SERVICE CONTROLLER, TOWER TRANSIT SINGAPORE</em>
</p>
<p>
<br>Minimising delays and inconveniences to commuters are also top priorities
when Mr Asri is called upon to deploy buses for a bridging service during
train disruptions. In these situations, he and his colleagues would have
to rush to identify bus captains who are available to man the service.</p>
<p>“During such emergencies, it’s crucial to remember to stay composed, take
a moment to calm down and to breathe,” he said. “This helps you to regain
control of your thoughts and actions.”</p>
<p>As his career progresses, Mr Asri is open to taking up new opportunities
in the bus operations control centre, or in the fields of bus operations
or management. For now, he plans to continue learning and growing in his
role as a bus service controller.</p>
<p>He added, “While this job can be&nbsp;challenging for newcomers, it becomes
very fulfilling once you learn the ropes.”</p>

<p><strong>Q: What intrigued you to pursue a career in the Public Transport industry?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>A: My passion for the public transport industry began with my keen interest
in driving and a curiosity about automotive vehicles. I joined as a Bus
Captain ten years ago and later took on the role as a Depot Supervisor,
further progressing my career in this field.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Share with us what you do as a Depot Supervisor.</strong>
</p>
<p>A: As a Depot Supervisor, my primary responsibilities include reviewing
the daily schedules of our Bus Captains and ensuring their duties are correctly
allocated. My role demands agility and the ability to think on my feet,
especially in handling unforeseen situations. I need to be well-versed
in various work procedures and always ready to provide advice to my colleagues.
When faced with a shortage of manpower, I am tasked with strategising how
best to utilise the available resources to maintain smooth operations and
high service standards.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the opportunities that the industry offers to graduates with technical or engineering qualifications?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>A: To better serve commuters in the future, we are transforming our urban
landscape through greener travel, greater connectivity and leveraging emerging
technologies to deliver smarter and better services. There will definitely
be opportunities for one to move into different areas, be it to support
the daily operations, or the engineering works to maintain our fleets.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What keeps you motivated in your role?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>A: The broad exposure to different areas of bus operations keeps me motivated
at work. Having the opportunity to understand the intricacies of the job
from the perspective of a Bus Captain enriches my understanding and enhances
my ability to effectively manage our operations. I am driven by a desire
to support and lend a helping hand to my team, ensuring that we overcome
challenges together.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Share with us any achievement or memorable moment you have experienced in your work.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A: One memorable achievement in my work occurred during an unexpected
downtime of our IT system. Faced with the challenge of continuing our daily
operations without the aid of technology, we had to revert to traditional
methods, using paper duty cards to reference the daily schedules. This
situation demanded exceptional teamwork and adaptability to ensure that
all duties were adequately catered for. It was a testament to the strength
and resilience of our team, reinforcing the importance of collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the challenges in your role, and how do you overcome them?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>A: One of the primary challenges in my role as a Depot Supervisor is managing
and allocating work amid unforeseen circumstances. These situations require
quick decision-making and effective resource management to make sure that
our daily operations continue smoothly. To overcome these challenges, I
need to rally the support of our Bus Captains. Their cooperation and flexibility
are crucial in adapting to the day's demands and meeting our operational
requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Q: As you look at the industry's future, what excites you the most?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Looking towards the future of the industry, what excites me the most
is the sense of accomplishment that comes from working in a challenging,
ever-changing environment. The integration of new technologies and the
dynamic nature of public transport operations offer continuous prospects
for learning and improvement. Additionally, the opportunity to serve the
people of Singapore and contribute positively to their daily lives provides
a sense of fulfillment.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What would you say to someone considering a role in the industry?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Be prepared for a ride! It will be enriching and fulfilling to witness
the public transport network running smoothly, which gives purpose to our
work.</p>

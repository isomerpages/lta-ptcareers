**Q: How did you become interested in a career with the public transport industry?**

A: I was introduced to the rail industry through an internship opportunity during my bachelors education in NTU. I was exposed to the power and rail engineering fields, and it opened up my mind to a whole other world no one seemed to be talking about at that moment. My 13-week long experience gave me an understanding of the potential this sunrise industry has to offer, from enabling people's safe and reliable travelling experience to transforming our train services through technologies. I've been in this industry for 5 years, and I am still interested in the work I do every day.

**Q: Tell us about what you do.**

A: At present, I am a Plans Manager in the Power Department. I manage Power Assets and oversee projected justifications of prospective projects, ensuring that our assets are renewed or replaced within the tolerances of the equipment's lifecycle. I work closely with System Management to carry out Asset Condition Assessments, Lifecycle Costing and Life Extension studies to balance and maximise the performance of an asset to its cost of operation.

**Q: What do you find fulfilling in your everyday work?**

A: I recognise and acknowledge that the decisions that we make today on how our systems operate and maintain will have a lasting impact on not just our colleagues on the ground, but the commuters using our services on a daily basis. With that being said, the most fulfilling part of my job is knowing that I have the ability to influence the future of our Rail Transport System. In a country that is becoming ever more urbanised, it is intriguing how complicated and advanced our systems will become. I hope to be part of the team to maintain our current and future infrastructure well so that we can serve our community better.

A: It's mentioned in the news as well, having tie-ups with universities such as Singapore Institute of Technology for Post-Graduate Programmes on Rail Transport. Such collaborations help us to develop a deeper understanding and holistic view of the industry and the business. We also have opportunities to strive for professional certification with organisations such as Institute of Engineers, Singapore (IES) and Professional Engineers Board (PEB).

**Q: As you look at the future of the industry, what excites you the most?**

A: With a mission to provide world-class transport service, , we've always been pushing the envelope with smart technologies, e.g. Track Access Management System (TAMS) and digital twin. Leveraging on these smart technologies, our future transport system has the potential to be the most sustainable mode of transport to drive greener commute to all in Singapore.

**Q: What would you say to someone considering a role with the industry?**

A: The industry is still young and there are tons of opportunities for innovation and growth. The multitude of projects that are planned for the future secures a meaningful and stable career.

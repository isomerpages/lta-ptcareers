**Q: Why did you choose to join the public transport industry?**

A: I have always been interested in buses, especially the technical aspects such as the parts and the electrical components. This sense of curiosity led me to join the public transport industry and I am enjoying my job very much! I learn something new every day.

**Q: What do you do in your role?**

A: As an Engineering Supervisor, I provide guidance to the Vehicle Technicians daily – be it for diagnostics or repairs. I also work closely with the Service Controllers from the Bus Operations Control Centre (BOCC) team to help the Bus Captains solve issues while they are on the roads. My job is never boring as I get to handle many different tasks daily. I am proud that I play a major role in ensuring that our buses are safe for our passengers.

**Q: What did you study and was it relevant in pursuing a career in the public transport industry?**

A: I studied mechanical design engineering, which is something quite relevant to the public transport industry. The course helped me understand the design, mechanics and electrical parts required to make vehicles run.

**Q: What kind of on-the-job training did you go through?**

A: When I first joined the company, I was attached to a senior engineering staff for a few weeks. I was given a chance to observe how the team handles their tasks. When I started doing my job on my own, my colleagues were always around to provide guidance whenever I needed. Overall, I would say that my OJT was a very hands-on one, and I was given a lot of opportunities to practise and that enabled me to do my job with more confidence.

**Q: As you look at the future of the industry, what excites you the most?**

A: I definitely concur with LTA’s vision of going fully electric by 2040. I am excited to see more e-buses on the roads in the near future. Electric vehicles require lower maintenance, and they have faster acceleration!

**Q: What would you say to someone considering a role with the industry?**

A: Go for it! The public transport industry is continuously evolving and it is an exciting place to be in. The job is also very meaningful as you will play a major role in ensuring that commuters reach their destination timely and safely.

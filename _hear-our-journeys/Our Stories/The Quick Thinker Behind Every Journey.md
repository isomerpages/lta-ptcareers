**Q: What intrigued you to pursue a career in the Public Transport industry?**

A: It’s fulfilling – we have a common goal of providing our commuters with a safe and pleasant journey. Also, this role is challenging and requires quick-thinking skills to troubleshoot any unplanned road situations.

**Q: Share with us what you do as a Service Controller.**

A: As an Executive Service Controller at SBS Transit, I ensure service reliability by monitoring the distance and time intervals between buses. I also coordinate with our on-ground staff to handle any incident on the road, such as service delays due to traffic congestion.

**Q: What keeps you motivated in your role?**

A: It gives me a great sense of achievement to provide smooth journeys and help commuters to reach their destinations safely and on time.

**Q: Share with us any achievement or memorable moment you have experienced in your work.**

A: Last year, a Service 860 Bus Captain (BC) called the Operations Control Centre about a lost student onboard the bus. I was sure that the young child, who was around 8 years old, felt very anxious and scared. I quickly advised the BC to reassure the child and send him to the nearest interchange at Yio Chu Kang. I then updated our interchange staff who contacted the school and someone came to pick up the child.

**Q: What are the challenges in your role, and how do you overcome them?**

A: Many of the incidents that occur are unplanned. We must always stay alert and react quickly to resolve issues that may suddenly occur – this may involve knowing which agency to liaise with.

**Q: As you look at the industry's future, what excites you the most?**

A: According to the Land Transport Master Plan, we can all travel from our homes to our workplaces within 45 minutes by 2040, even during peak periods! This would make travelling so much more convenient and I really look forward to it.

**Q: What would you say to someone considering a role in the industry?**

A: This is probably one of the most fulfilling careers you can consider joining! You will never be bored as every day is a new and enriching experience.

<p><strong>Q: What intrigued you to pursue a career in the Public Transport industry?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: I have always admired the efficiency of Singapore’s railway system.
Its seamless transition from above ground to underground tracks and the
implementation of driverless trains inspired me to learn more about how
train systems work!</p>
<p>To expand my knowledge, I undertook a traffic controller training programme.
It provided me with essential insights into train and station operations,
backend operations and emergency preparedness.</p>
<p>With a degree in Electrical Electronic Engineering, I possess a strong
foundation in communications and programming, which has been invaluable
in my current role in Radio Communications Systems.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Share with us what you do.</strong>
</p>
<p>A: As a Systems Engineer, I am responsible for managing the Radio Communication
Systems on the Downtown Line. I lead a team of Assistant Engineers and
Technicians to ensure the regular maintenance of our Radio Communication
Systems, which is essential for the efficient operation of our train services.</p>
<p>Additionally, I analyse and investigate technical issues within the Radio
Communication Systems. I lead initiatives focused on system upgrades, and
as we are currently in the upgrading phase, I actively present and address
system defects and train faults, as well as troubleshooting to overcome
these challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the opportunities that the industry offers to graduates with technical or engineering qualifications?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: SBS Transit Rail offers a dynamic career path with numerous growth
opportunities. You have the flexibility to choose your path and shape your
professional journey according to your interests and goals.</p>
<p>The company provides extensive support and training, ensuring you have
the resources needed to succeed. You will have access to a variety of professional
courses designed to keep you current with the latest engineering technologies
and processes. These courses equip you with the skills and knowledge to
competently address and resolve system issues.</p>
<p>For instance, the Data Analytics course is useful for understanding fault
frequencies, identifying patterns, and preventing future issues. Additionally,
the Internet of Things (IoT) course enhances your programming skills, enabling
you to troubleshoot issues more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What keeps you motivated in your role?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: My appreciation for our train network has deepened as I have come to
understand the intricate systems required to ensure seamless operation.
Witnessing the transformation brought by upgraded radio communication systems
has been professionally enriching and has significantly enhanced the efficiency
and safety of public transportation. I feel a strong sense of accomplishment
knowing that these advancements help provide a safe and reliable travel
experience for our passengers.</p>
<p>I also value our supportive work culture. My colleagues and I champion
teamwork, sharing knowledge and collaborating to resolve technical issues.
This collaborative environment makes our work both enjoyable and effective!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Share with us any achievement or memorable moment you have experienced in your work.</strong>
</p>
<p>A: One weekend, relatively new to my role, I received a call from the
radio manager at the Downtown Line’s Operation Control Centre. They needed
assistance with a radio system fault during normal operational hours. I
was able to provide step-by-step guidance over the phone and successfully
rectify the fault. This experience gave me a strong sense of achievement,
knowing that I helped my team and ensured smooth operations.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the challenges in your role, and how do you overcome them?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Radio communication systems are crucial to train operations. This communication
line must be well maintained, as it serves as a communication channel between
each department, station and train, which is especially crucial during
an emergency.</p>
<p>Performing corrective maintenance during engineering hours can be challenging,
as these hours typically fall outside normal operating times.</p>
<p>For instance, one morning at a particular station, the trains lost communication
with our Operations Control Centre. We swiftly went to the scene to investigate
and successfully restored the communications to ensure our operations continued
to run smoothly. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: As you look at the industry's future, what excites you the most?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: The ongoing expansion and development of Singapore’s train network
mark significant progress in enhancing our transportation system. This
development not only promotes accessibility but also supports sustainability,
ultimately improving the quality of life for residents.</p>
<p>With extensive train network across the island, I hope there is a reduced
reliance on cars. This shift contributes to a greener and more efficient
urban landscape. I am proud to be a part of the team that keeps Singapore
moving.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What would you say to someone considering a role in the industry?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: The public transport industry offers a wide range of career opportunities
to make a tangible impact on communities. Beyond technical tasks, you will
also work closely with different teams and stakeholders to enhance the
commuting experience for our passengers. It's not just a job; it's a fulfilling
path where you can grow personally and professionally while providing for
your family.</p>

<p>Like most children, Ms Ng Yuen Fong used to peek curiously at the MRT
tracks through the station platform’s screen doors before the train arrived.</p>
<p>As fate would have it, she now spends a good part of her time at work
observing the tracks in her role as a permanent way (P-way) engineer. Looking
back fondly at her younger self, Ms Ng, who joined SMRT Trains in 2015,
enthused: “I&nbsp;never thought that I would one day become the cool person
who gets to walk and work on the track!”</p>

<p><em>As a permanent way engineer, Ms Ng Yuen Fong helps ensure that the tracks are in optimal condition for the safe passage of trains.</em>
</p>
<p>As their job titles suggest, the main job scope of P-way engineers revolves
around the permanent way – the railroad tracks on which trains run.</p>
<p>“The permanent way is the backbone of safe and efficient railway operations,”
explained Ms Ng. “As a P-way engineer, it is my responsibility to ensure
that the tracks are in optimal condition to facilitate the safe passage
of trains, and improve operational reliability.”</p>
<p>For trains to run smoothly, railway tracks must be properly aligned and
levelled, while sleepers – which support the rails and distribute the load
of the train – must be securely fastened and correctly spaced. P-way engineers
like Ms&nbsp;Ng review data from track condition monitoring systems and
inspection teams; plan and supervise maintenance; and oversee the repair
and replacement of various track components.</p>
<p>With the advancement of technology, P-way engineers are using tools to
fuel developments in the rail industry. For&nbsp;instance, they use the
linear variable differential transformer, which allows real-time monitoring
of the third rail’s position – the live rail which provides electric power
to a train through a conductor placed along the rails. P-way engineers
also get to work with multi-function vehicles, which are engineering trains
equipped with a rail flaw detection and track geometry measurement system.</p>

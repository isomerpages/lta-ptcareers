<p><strong>Q: Share with us what you do.</strong>
</p>
<p>A: I am a Digital Service and Technology (DST) Engineer within the Permanent
Way and Civil Structure department at Gali Batu Depot.</p>
<p>My role involves leveraging data analysis to drive enhancements in railway
efficiency and performance. I design, implement and manage digital solutions
that optimise engineering processes and integrate digital technologies
with existing systems. I also troubleshoot technical issues and develop
software tools to ensure our tracks are optimal for safe and smooth rides.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is 'P-way'?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: P-way, the abbreviation of Permanent Way, refers to the finished track
for a railway.</p>
<p>In the earlier days of railway construction, contractors often laid temporary
tracks to transport construction materials to and from the site; these
temporary tracks are removed when the work is completed. Thus, Permanent
Way is used to distinguish the final finished tracks from the temporary
ones.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What intrigued you to pursue a career in the Public Transport industry?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: After completing my degree in Aerospace Engineering and an internship
focused on machine learning and non-destructive testing, I became fascinated
by the intersection of technology and transportation.</p>
<p>The potential to harness digital solutions to enhance connectivity and
mobility within communities inspired me to join this dynamic public transport
industry.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the opportunities that the industry offers to graduates with technical or engineering qualifications?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: SBS Transit Rail provides graduates with diverse opportunities to embark
on a meaningful career. Graduates receive comprehensive career onboarding,
project management courses and technical training to equip them with the
necessary knowledge and skills in rail services and safety standards.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What keeps you motivated in your role?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: The opportunity to grow my skills and make a tangible impact on optimising
engineering processes! I love my job, and working with a supportive team
that values innovation inspires me to achieve long-term success.</p>
<p>Recently, I led an automation project for our department’s documentation
system, which helped reduce the manhours needed for manual updates. Knowing
that my efforts helped enhance the quality of workflows for my fellow colleagues
gives me a sense of fulfilment.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Share with us any achievement or memorable moment you have experienced in your work.</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Last November, I had the opportunity to go on a work trip to China.
The purpose was to conduct a project site acceptance test and observe the
progress of a new system. This enriching experience not only enhanced my
professional skills but also allowed me to immerse myself in a different
culture and collaborate with colleagues from diverse backgrounds. It was
a great learning opportunity which significantly contributed to my personal
and professional growth.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the challenges in your role, and how do you overcome them?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Ensuring seamless integration of digital solutions into existing engineering
processes while addressing technical hurdles can be quite challenging.
Overcoming these challenges requires proactive problem-solving, open communication,
collaboration, and continuous learning to stay ahead of technological advancements.</p>
<p><strong>Q: As you look at the industry's future, what excites you the most?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: I am excited to be part of the team that is dedicated to advancing
digitalisation and automation in Singapore’s public transport network!
By integrating cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence,
Internet of Things (IoT), and predictive analytics, we can significantly
enhance railway efficiency, reliability, and passenger experience.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What would you say to someone considering a role in the industry?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: The public transport industry presents a fulfilling and rewarding journey
filled with opportunities for growth, learning, and meaningful contributions
to society.</p>
<p>If you're passionate and ready to embark on a path where your efforts
make a tangible difference in the lives of others while advancing your
own career aspirations, then the rail industry awaits you with open arms!</p>

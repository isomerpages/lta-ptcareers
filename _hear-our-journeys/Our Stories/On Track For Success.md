<p>Singapore’s Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system has grown from strength to
strength since the launch of the North-South Line in 1987 – so too has
the career of Mr Moksin Mahsan, who joined SMRT Trains in&nbsp;1986.</p>
<p>Recalling the buzz around the government’s decision to build the MRT system,
Mr Moksin, said that he was attracted to the industry as it offered stability.
“In 1986, Singapore was still recovering from a recession. I was on the
lookout for more secure opportunities after four years doing sales and
design at an air-conditioning firm,” he shared.</p>

<p><em>Mr Moksin Mahsan joined SMRT Trains as a railway supervisor in 1986, a year before the MRT system officially opened.</em>
</p>
<p>Mr Moksin was also motivated to contribute meaningfully to the then-nascent
vision of building a transportation system that could move millions of
people across Singapore daily.</p>
<p>Starting out as a railway supervisor a year before the MRT system officially
opened, Mr Moksin eventually became a senior manager in the North-South
and East-West Lines’ Operations Control Centre in 2017. His long and distinguished
career underscores not only his personal achievements but also the ample
opportunities for growth and progress in a vibrant and essential industry.</p>
<p>“In the Operations Control Centre (OCC), we ensure the smooth operation
of trains to provide safe, timely and reliable service to our commuters,”
he shared. “We also manage delays and work closely with the Land Transport
Authority (LTA) and other line operators to minimise inconvenience to our
passengers.”</p>

<p><em>As a senior manager in the Operations Control Centre, Mr Moksin says that it’s important for him to provide clear directions and guidance to his team especially during time-sensitive situations such as train delays or security incidents.</em>
</p>
<p>Even with his wealth of experience in other roles – including as a chief
controller that oversaw the daily operation of train services for the North-South
and East-West Lines – Mr Moksin was initially apprehensive about whether
he could make the right calls during time-sensitive situations, such as
train delays or security incidents, during his early days working in the
OCC.</p>
<p>“Poor decision-making impacts service recovery and safety for both commuters
and ground crew,” he explained. “It’s&nbsp;important that I provide clear
directions and guidance to my team to ensure that incidents are resolved
effectively and swiftly.”</p>
<p>To ensure he could excel in his current role, he actively sought insights
from his colleagues and meticulously reviewed every incident. His methodical
approach not only facilitated the acquisition of essential information
but also sharpened his situational awareness, empowering him to anticipate
possible operational challenges with precision.</p>

</p>
<p><em>– MR MOKSIN MAHSAN, SENIOR MANAGER, OPERATIONS CONTROL CENTRE</em>
</p>
<p><strong>BUILDING A CAREER THROUGH GROUNDBREAKING PROJECTS</strong>
</p>
<p>One of the most satisfying moments of Mr Moksin’s career emerged from
one of its most challenging periods: The&nbsp;upgrading of the old legacy
signalling system to the new Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC).</p>
<p>The mammoth project spanned four years. From 2015 to 2018, Mr Moksin and
his team went through multiple trainings, along with testing and commissioning
rounds, leading up to trial runs on the East-West Line and later on, the
North-South Line.</p>
<p>He recounted: “The transitional period was very tough as we needed to
overcome system faults that we were unfamiliar with.”</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p><em>Mr Moksin says that the upgrading of the old legacy signalling system to the new Communications-Based Train Control was a&nbsp;significant&nbsp;milestone for him and his team.</em>
</p>
<p>In 2019, the trial runs were completed and the OCC itself shifted from
Victoria Street to Kim Chuan depot, marking the end of an era.</p>
<p>“We learnt and worked together as a team. We are now armed with new knowledge
and skills,” reflected Mr&nbsp;Moksin. “This was a significant milestone
for all of us, and I am happy and proud to have been a part of this meaningful&nbsp;transformation.”</p>

<p><strong>A CAREER THAT OFFERS GROWTH AND LONGEVITY</strong>
</p>
<p>Like Mr Moksin, Mr Tengku Mohamed Boestaman, a duty operations manager
at SBS Transit, was drawn to the rail industry for the ample opportunities
it offered to do something meaningful as a career.</p>
<p>After more than 12 years in the manufacturing sector, Mr Tengku was looking
to transition to a more stable industry during a global downturn in 2000.
He joined SBS Transit in 2001 and was seconded to LTA as a works train
operator for a year to gain more experience in train operations.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="box-sizing: inherit; border-style: none; display: block; height: auto; max-width: 100%; border-radius: 0px; line-height: 1.4; width: 760px; padding-top: 20px;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--hi6mRaaM--/c_fill,g_auto,h_468,w_830/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2024/01/02/bstudio_lta_railops_img04.jpg?itok=SnUk_-0o">
</div>
<p><em>Mr Tengku Mohamed Boestaman oversees 34 stations, 52 trains and 160 staff members in his role as a duty operations manager at SBS Transit.</em>
</p>
<p>Over time, Mr Tengku rose through the ranks following stints in the Sengkang-Punggol
Light Rail Transit (LRT) system as a trainer and a customer service executive
before being deployed as a station manager at the North East Line in&nbsp;2007.</p>
<p>With his strong work ethic and excellent performance, Mr Tengku was promoted
to a duty operations manager in 2019. He oversees the 34 stations, 52 trains
and 160 staff members of the Downtown Line when he is on shift, in addition
to carrying out station exercises and operational&nbsp;planning.</p>
<p>“The daily challenges – which span manpower planning, executing projects,
managing staff and contractors, dealing with passengers, and handling audits
and assessments – keep each day interesting and engaging,” he said.</p>
<p>What gives Mr Tengku the greatest satisfaction, however, is building relationships
with passengers. He fondly recalls striking up friendships with a group
of students who would greet him whenever they took the train, witnessing
them mature from primary school students to youths attending college. “The
front-facing nature of the job, where I get to interact with people from
all walks of life and help them with their journeys, makes it meaningful
and satisfying,” he&nbsp;added.</p>
<h4><strong>A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A STATION MANAGER</strong></h4>
<p>5.30am: Inspect the communications log for any outstanding issues from
the previous shift that require follow-up actions. Ensure that all equipment
is working and that the station is ready to receive its first passengers
of the day.</p>
<p>6.30am: Do a station walkabout, including safety and security checks.
These checks are performed every two hours throughout the station’s operating
hours.</p>
<p>7.30am to 9.30am: Manage the morning peak-hour rush. “I will be at the
station platform to help manage passengers’ entry to and exit from trains,”
recalled Mr Tengku. “I will also handle passengers’ queries, assist the
ones who need help topping up their EZ-Link cards, and ensure the safe
and smooth running of the station.”</p>
<p>Rest of the day: Manage a team of assistant station managers, conduct
refresher trainings and assessments, and handle administrative tasks like
manpower planning.</p>
<p><strong>ESTABLISHING CONNECTIONS WITH COLLEAGUES AND COMMUTERS</strong>
</p>
<p>Given the people-oriented nature of Mr Tengku’s job, possessing empathy
and demonstrating kindness are key attributes that have contributed to
success in his role.</p>
<p>During his time as a station manager at Punggol Station, Mr Tengku encountered
a regular commuter who used a motorised wheelchair and communicated using
a touch-to-talk device. “One day, his wheelchair malfunctioned,” he recounted.
“But as I was able to get his address, I offered to push him back home.”</p>
<p>Mr Tengku was glad that he was able to render assistance to someone in
his time of need. Following this incident, he forged a friendship with
the commuter, who always sought him out to say hello. He even brought his
wife along to introduce her to Mr Tengku. The fact that the commuter had
gone to great lengths to do so was not lost on Mr Tengku as he had been
posted to another station by that time.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p><em>Mr Tengku says that as his job is people-oriented, it’s important to possess empathy and show kindness to both passengers and co-workers alike.</em>
</p>
<p>Mr Tengku is also appreciative of the caring and supportive environment
at SBS Transit, encapsulated in the company’s guiding principle, “SBS Transit
CARES”. This ethos not only underscores the organisation’s dedication to
delivering excellent service to commuters, but also reflects the company’s
commitment to the health and professional growth of its employees.</p>

</p>
<p><em>– MR TENGKU MOHAMED BOESTAMAN, DUTY OPERATIONS MANAGER, SBS TRANSIT</em>
</p>
<h4><strong>WHAT ARE SOME ESSENTIAL QUALITIES THAT STATION MANAGER SHOULD POSSESS?</strong></h4>
<p>“All station managers should be proactive in solving problems, willing
to extend a helping hand to passengers and open to picking up new skills.
The tasks we perform vary from the service recovery of station equipment
– such as fare gates, ticketing machines and fire alarm systems – to being
qualified in first aid,” said Mr Tengku.</p>
<p>“Soft skills are also important when we interact with passengers. We need
to be good listeners and be open to feedback. We must also show empathy
when passengers are in difficult situations or when our colleagues need
our help.”</p>

<p>Mr Tengku, who joked that the expansion of the Downtown Line from Bukit
Panjang to Expo had since expanded his lunchtime options, emphasised that
he still has much to learn even after two decades in the railway industry.
“Our training needs are reviewed periodically and the organisation is always
open to us learning new things so that we can progress in our careers,”
he said.</p>
<p>In the near future, Mr Tengku plans to take up more training courses to
improve his soft skills. “I look forward to advancing my leadership and
management skills, as well as sharing my knowledge with others,” he said.
“There is always room for progression if you’re willing to work hard, interact
with people from different backgrounds and walks of life, and embrace new
perspectives and ways of working.”</p>
